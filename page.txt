  Work and Travel in Canada

   The Canadian Working Holiday Program, also known as "CWHP", is a program
   designed for applicants who want to come to Canada to work and travel.
   This program meets the demands of Canadian employers, while enabling
   international young people to earn some income to support their holiday in
   Canada. GO International provides valuable assistance to participants with
   settling in, finding a job and accommodation and getting to know Canada.

  This program is designed for IEC participants, who have to be nominated by a
  Recognized Organization.

   Please read our [68]FAQ section for answers to the most common questions.

   While we would like to be able to meet everyone's request for
   participation in the program, please understand that we are limited in the
   spots we can offer to both first time and second time applicants, and we
   will not be able to accommodate all applications.

  The Highlights

   Spend an absolutely amazing vacation working in Canada and truly
   "experience" the people, the unique natural beauty and the adrenaline rush
   that you can only get from this country. Participants in the Working
   Holiday program meet locals, gain international work experience, earn
   money to travel and make the most of their working holiday in Canada with
   us.

   Whether you are planning to be a ski bum, a city slicker, or an outdoor
   traveler... let us help you get a running start to your new adventure.

   Have a look below for information about our RO Sponsored Package:

   [69]RO Sponsored Launch Pad

   You will be provided with personal assistance for the whole duration of
   your program. Think of having a tour guide/program adviser at your
   disposal! ("When do I need to file my taxes? Where is the best place to
   eat sushi? How do I buy a car here?");

   You will receive emergency support (so you parents won't have to lie awake
   at night worrying about you);

   You will be able to access to job searching apps like Kibby and receive
   personal job assistance, ensuring you get a JOB FAST.

   Connect with people - you will meet like-minded travelers in your
   orientation group and you may end up meeting your future roommate/or new
   best friend!

  Did you know?

   As part of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC),
   the International Experience Canada (IEC) program facilitates travel and
   work opportunities for Canadian and foreign national youth. The program
   provides the opportunity to gain life-changing personal and professional
   experience by travelling and working in Canada or abroad. The mandate of
   IEC is to enhance key bilateral relationships between Canada and other
   countries and territories and emphasize the importance of improved
   participation reciprocity. IEC supports Canada's economic and cultural
   interests by administering bilateral, reciprocal agreements and
   arrangements with 35 countries and territories (also known as youth
   mobility arrangements, or YMAs). Agreements and arrangements are generally
   open to Canadian and foreign youth aged 18 to 35.

   Have a look [71]here for more information about International Experience
   Canada.

  Second Timers

   In past seasons, we were able to offer a small amount of spots to "Second
   Timers" (applicants, who have already participated in the IEC Program and
   are looking for a repeat IEC participation since they have exhausted their
   other options of staying in Canada). These spots are very limited and
   depend on our overall allocation each season.

   As a second timer, you are usually not looking for the same services as
   someone who is coming to Canada for the first time and who might not have
   lived abroad before.

   Please note that we are not able to sell "visa only" packages, however
   there are great advantages of booking the Canadian Working Holiday Program
   with GO International if you are a second timer:

   If you meet all the requirements and we offer you a spot in the program,
   we will nominate you for an invitation to apply for the IEC Program.

   Support and assistance from GO International staff throughout the entire
   duration of your program (e.g. 24/7 emergency number, e-mail and phone
   support and in-person assistance in GO International offices in Vancouver
   and Toronto).

   We will update you on immigration, entry and activation regulations.

   If you lose your job, you can use our resources (e.g. Kibbi) to find
   another employment opportunity.

   We can connect you to professional immigration consultants or legal
   advisors, if needed.

   We offer you discounted rates for our Language, Career and Pathway
   programs through our parent company [72]Tamwood International College.

   You will receive information on how to extend your Social Insurance Number
   and file your tax return.

   In our newsletters, we will provide you with tips specific to temporary
   residents, who have lived in Canada for more than one year (such as
   immigration updates, current job postings, etc.).

  Option To Add English / Career Training Programs

   Participants in the [73]Working Holiday Program have the option to add an
   English course, IELTS preparation course, and/or a [74]career training
   diploma program in International Business, Entrepreneurship, Digital
   Marketing or Hospitality and Tourism to their work program.

   We suggest these optional study programs as a way to enhance your
   education, improve your employment prospects and provide you with
   additional skills and credentials that enhance your eligibility for
   Canadian immigration.

   Please contact GO International or your booking agent for a full list of
   optional study programs available through GO International's sister
   college and language school and for a price quote for these optional
   services.
